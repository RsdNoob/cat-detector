## Cat Detection Dataset

![First_dataset](/image/pic2.png)

As shown above, the first step will be training of R-CNN object detector to detect cats in input images.

This dataset contains 200 images (some images contain more than one cat). The annotation was manually created using LabelImg.

The dataset is from <a href="https://academictorrents.com/details/c501571c29d16d7f41d159d699d0e7fb37092cbd">Cat Annotation Dataset</a>.
